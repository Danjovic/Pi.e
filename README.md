# Pi.e
The Pi.e form factor consists of a PCB with dimensions in the proportion of 3.14 by 2.78 units. For practical purposes the units can be either metric (in centimeters) or imperial (inches).

The metric boards are fine for tiny gadgets like the AVeRcade board, while the imperial boards, slightly larger than a credit card, are great for develpment boards and badges.
